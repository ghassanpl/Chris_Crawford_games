Hi Chris --

	This is the understanding I have of each of the POV's.  A few questions still remain:

	1.	GOSSIP	The story/event in the third person, past tense.  Told to Arthur at court or wherever he happens to be at the time.

	2.	FOLLOWUP	Same as gossip, but characters have already been introduced, so are only referred to, not mentioned by name.

	3.	SUBJECT	The character describes his/her actions.  Reworded from GOSSIP so the character can justify his or her actions. Just place in first person OR/ "This POV will OFTEN require a complete rewording from the gossip POV to reflect how speakers embellish or excuse their behavior." (WHEN IS IT OK TO EMBELLISH?)

	4.	DIROBJECT	Take gossip and copy it with grammatical changes from the second character's POV.  He/she can just describe the events the way they happened. OR/ "This POV will OFTEN require a complete rewording from the gossip POV to reflect how speakers embellish or excuse their behavior." (SEE #3 ABOVE)

	5.	SUBJECT FOLLOWUP	Same as subject except direct object's name is changed to approprate pronoun.

	6.	DIRECT OBJECT FOLLOWUP 	Same as subject except subject's name is changed to approprate pronoun.
	7.	MENU		Arthur can take an action, speak to a character (HOW DO WE KNOW WHO HE ADDRESSES-SUBJ OR DIROBJ?), or speak to himself.  Is this the place where the player can choose how Arthur responds thus affecting the flow of the story?  Or is there an "Arthur Zone" that the player clicks on to find out what Arthur is thinking or will do in this point?  

Understanding Arthur's psychology (as YOU see him) would help a lot.

	8.	TO ARTHUR		Character addresses Arthur. (Which character?  Is it always the subject character?)

	9.	WITNESS	Arthur witnesses the action himself.  So the text is identical to Gossip except in present tense?  He's just seeing this, no one  is telling him this?

*****

	I've had several thoughts about Mort d'Arthur, and how to best proceed from this point.

	The go-round with the first ten sample scripts has distilled important information in several areas.  It has also brought up several fundamental issues that we need to deal with.  I need to have a clear vision of what I am writing for in order to create reasonable dialogue.  I feel I am still stumbling around in the dark.

	1.	MODE OF GAMEPLAY:	As I understand it, the player is Arthur, the world is the (walled?) population center of Camelot and its immediate environs, the time frame is in the neighborhood of 500 AD, and the general ambience is Celtic, not medieval.  How Arthur moves around in this world and interacts with other characters I am still fuzzy about.  Maybe you can talk me through the first few minutes of typical gameplay again.  Also Arthur's personality is not clear.  From the text you have provided for him, he seems a little nebbishy.  Is this how a warlord/king would act?  I need to know your thinking on this.

	2.	STORY ELEMENTS OF THE GAME:	The game generates stories, or legends.  At the end of the game, the player can get a printout of these stories.  In composing the elements of these stories (and, very importantly, their alternate forms), and the progressive relationships of characters within these stories, I need to have a much better idea of what motivates the characters to take the actions they take.  How can I determine how a character should react (happy, sad, angry, whatever) without knowing the character's personality and the back-story to the given situation? Or, barring that, I need to know what emotional options are allowed within the scene.  Otherwise I am writing random reactions to situations coming out of a vacuum.

You have asked me to present alternative mindsets for the characters within a single substory.    For example:  in AGREETODEMAND you have asked me to create options whereby the character could either grudgingly acquiesce or leap at the opportunity.  If these are random, then there is no such thing as a consistent personality in the game.  That will make for a pretty weird game.  

	3.	CHARACTER DEFINITION AND DEVELOPMENT:	The same goes for the characters.  What motivates them as individuals?  Characters acting in generic ways is the essence of bad writing.  What makes a character interesting and involving to an audience is specifics.  It is always best when a specific individual creates the general character type, but the more a character becomes a generic cutout (be he/she doctor, warrior, whatever) the less an audience cares for him/her.  I should have a character list so I can at least know who might be saying my lines.  You say you know who is likely to say or do certian things.  Shouldn't I know that, too? 

	4.	STYLE:	In contrast to your original request for an archaic style as well as thees and thous, we are now turned 180 degrees around to using a more modern tone.  In terms of vocabulary, some exotic words ("dictionary words") are deemed acceptable.  In going over the notes from our phone conversation, however, it is not clear to me which words are OK and which not [e.g. priapic is OK, escutcheon not], and the same goes for aspects of the style structure.  Either you must be extremely clear on the front end about this, or be prepared to do more editing -- in which case I must generate considerably more material (and take considerably more of my time to do it).  

	5.	RESEARCH:	As you know, another factor in this is that part of good writing is being true to the world you are creating.  This means researching that world through books, pictures, documentaries, and all other means possible.  Typically I do a lot of this before I write, and then continue it through the process.  The time this takes is significant, and has to be factored in to the time it takes to generate the stories.
	
	6.	WHERE WE STAND NOW:	  What we are really doing at this stage is not trying to knock out some scripts, it is trying to figure out how to get to the point where we are ready to knock out some scripts, which is quite a different activity.

I feel that the primary value of the work we have done up to now has come from raising fundamental structural questions in the gameplay, and in forcing you to define and redefine crucial issues without which the writing can not proceed.  We don't know if we have answered all the questions about structure and style or not.  Uncovering and addressing these issues are what you are paying me for at this stage of the game, not the ten scripts.  The ten scripts are test samples.
	
	7.	FOR THE NEXT GROUP:	  Why not take substory events and work on all of the GoTos that derive from that substory.  Since each of these feeds into 3 or 4 other stories I can be thinking about the flow of events and emotions that will be appropriate for the characters involved and the story development.  This way as a writer, I can actually do some writing.

Once we're through the next group, I will try to estimate what is really involved to do the whole project.

So, for the next $1,000 I suggest:
1.	Doing 25 scripts.
2.	A big swipe at the basic research which is necessary.
3.	We'll continue to discuss the structural elements.  If this discussion becomes minimal, then it's a win for everyone.

	Once this is done, we will, hopefully, be at the end of the consultation stage and we'll have a pretty good idea of what it takes to generate these scripts.  At that point you need to talk with Lee Dinstman at APA to negotiate the full scale project.
