Arthur stood watching for a moment; his men waited for the order to kill or to spare Mordred. Then Arthur stepped forward, his shield raised against the hail of blows that Mordred loosed against him. These he warded off expertly, and then, timing his move carefully, he simply shoved his shield into Mordred, who was thrown off balance. Arthur pushed again, and Mordred went down. A quick thrust to the neck, and Mordred's last curse became a gurgle.%It was an ugly, brutal fight. Men who had formerly been friends slew each other with wild abandon. But the weight of numbers lay with Arthur, and after an hour the more faint-hearted members of Mordred's force began to melt away into the forest. Soon even the boldest could see that all was lost, and took to their heels. Arthur's loyalists, their bloodlust sated, let them go in safety. Only Mordred, with no place to run, refused to admit defeat. Desperately he challenged Arthur to single combat, his last hope in a hopeless situation. Arthur was in no mood for such romantic ?

The gathered crowd shivers in the cold and waits, hushed. At last you decide that sunrise must have occurred. You signal to two guards, who enter the prison hut and emerge with <DirObjectName> between them. A few cries of anguish break out from the crowd. The guards march <DirObjectName> to the execution block, where you wait. King and condemned stare at each other for a long minute. Then you cry in a loud voice, “I condemn you to death! Carry out the execution!” <DirObjectName> scowls as <DirObjectHe> is pushed to <DirObjectHisHer> knees and bent over so that <DirObjectHisHer> head rests on the block. One guard holds <DirObjectHim> there while the other steps back and draws his sword. He carefully squares his stance then looks to you for the final nod. Your pause before giving it reflects not hesitation but emphasis. The heavy sword rises high above the executioner's head, wavers while he gathers his strength, then slices down in a motion so swift that it makes the crowd jump even before the impact. The sound of the thud is lost in the gasp of the crowd. A female voice cries out, “No!”, then a man's voice echoes the protest. The executioner did his job well; it was a clean cut. The head falls from the block and rolls several feet; the body slumps sideways. You stare at the headless corpse and feel an awful swelling in your throat. Then you become aware of sobbing from somewhere in the crowd, and a low murmuring, and your sense of duty pushes your feelings aside. You face the crowd, trying to look confident and certain, yet sober and serious, respectful of the awful power you have just exercised. It is so important now to communicate gravity rather than anger! “Everybody, listen!” you shout, and wait for the silence to spread through the group. “This is a terrible day for all of us. <DirObjectName> committed a grave crime, for which death was the only sentence.

One by one, all of Arthur's and all of Mordred's great knights fell. At length only Arthur, Percival, and Mordred remained standing. Mordred seized a spear and ran towards Arthur, shouting, “Now is thy death day come!” He ran him through, yet Arthur remained standing, quiet and calm. Mordred stood transfixed, staring wide-eyed at the king who would not die. Then Arthur gripped the shaft of the spear in his hands and pulled himself down the spear, walking slowly towards the still disbelieving Mordred. He brought himself eyeball to eyeball with Mordred, whose eyes now bulged out of their sockets in horror. So transfixed was he that he never felt the tip of Excalibur enter his abdomen and slide upward, slashing past liver and spleen until it found his heart and ripped it open. Mordred simply rolled his head back and died where he stood.Arthur stood for a moment, then suddenly fell to his knees. “Percival,” he called out.“Here, $” came the reply.“Take Excalibur; find a pool of calm water; throw Excalibur into the pool.”Percival stared in disbelief. “No, $! This cannot be!”“Do it!” Arthur commanded.Percival sadly took the sword from Arthur's bloody-white hands and rode off in search of a pool.He found it a mile distant, in a hidden fold in the hills; he would never have guessed from the terrain that it harbored such a clear and beautiful pool. He made ready to hurl the sword into the water, but then hesitated and, thinking more, decided to hide the sword in some bushes and return to Arthur. By the time he found Arthur, the king had crawled to a small rise in the ground, and was very weak.“When you threw the sword into the lake, what did you see?” he asked.“Nothing, $, but the wind on the waves.”“You have betrayed me, Percival. Can you not find the loyalty to honor my last request of you?”“$, the sword is too important. Perhaps another man can be found to wield it.”“Fear not, Percival; when that man comes, the sword will rise again, as it did for me. Now, do as I command!”Percival sadly took his leave of Arthur and rode back to the pool. He retrieved the sword from its hiding place and stood at the edge of the pool. He leaned back and hurled it far and high. A hand slowly emerged from the center of the pool, and the sword fell perfectly into the hand's grasp. For two seconds, maybe three, the hand held Excalibur aloft; then it slid into the waters and disappeared.When Percival returned, Arthur was nowhere to be seen. Three maidens had borne him off to the Isle of Avalon, there to be healed of his wounds. And someday, when he is healed, and when the world truly needs him, the sword will rise from the pool, and Arthur will be king again.--FollowUp--%The battle was long and bloody, with many men falling on both sides.

A king’s greatest gift to his people is the order he imposes upon them. It is the king’s law that guarantee’s each man’s place in society.

Back then, Roman law gave each man a place, and insured that all worked together harmoniously. But look at your Britain: a lawless place with no sense of structure or order. Few men have masters, and those that do thumb their noses at their masters. Here in Camelot, there is no line of command. If you give an order, it may or may not carried out.

When you do bother to ride out at their head, you enforce no march discipline; they chatter away as if on a picnic.

Your voice is gentle and mellifluous; no anger grates in your larynx. A king must command! He must communicate power and authority to all around him.

Mordred kicked the shield away and hacked downward with his sword. Arthur tried to ward off the blows with his arm, but to little avail. Mordred hacked and hacked away, sweating and cursing at the effort; it took many blows before the screams stopped and many more before Arthur lay still.--FollowUp--%The battle went badly for Arthur's men.

His sword is huge and his shield is massive enough to stop any thrust. He heads straight towards <SubjectName>'s group, and they edge back in fear. Realizing that this man must be stopped, <SubjectName> leaps off her horse and steps forward. Her bow is strung and ready. She launches a bolt at the Saxon, who blocks it easily with his shield and laughs derisively as he bores down on her. Quick as a flash, another arrow is strung and launched -- with similar results. Her death appears imminent. The Saxon swings his sword and she ducks to the left. The weight of the sword carries his arm forward and twists his body slightly to the right. Still leaping sideways, she looses another arrow which hits his sword arm. The shock of pain and the impact of the sword on the ground cause him to lose his grip; the sword clatters to the ground. Suddenly <SubjectName>'s men surge forward and assault the big warrior; he dies quickly.--Witness--%?--AdviseAgainst--%?--AdviseNegative--%?--AdviseUncertain--%?--AdvisePositive--%?--AdviseFor--%?--WhatsGoingOn--%<SubjectName> has a lot of spunk.***SingleCombatMale***--Gossip--%<SubjectName> engaged a Saxon in single combat and emerged victorious.--FollowUp--%?--Subject--%?--DirObject--%?--SubjectFollowup--%?--DirObjectFollowup--%?--Menu--%?--ToArthur--%<SubjectName> is riding his horse in front of his men, taunting the Saxons, when one of them steps forward to take up the challenge. <SubjectName> dismounts and hands the reins to an attendent, then turns to face the Saxon. The man hurls a heavy spear at <SubjectName>; it penetrates his light shield and bites into a leather strap across his belly before stopping. <SubjectName> sheds the now-useless shield and takes his sword in both hands; clearly, his chances are much reduced now, and his face shows it. The Saxon grins so widely you can see several gaps in his teeth. <SubjectName> hurls himself against the warrior, smashing his sword into the man's shield with all his strength. The Saxon takes the blow well, sinking to his knees to absorb the impact without losing his balance. He slashes back and <SubjectName> dances away with a thin line of red showing through a torn tunic. Now the Saxon launches his attack, and <SubjectName> has no place to hide. He parries several blows with his sword, but takes an ugly blow from the edge of the Saxon's shield on his teeth. Staggering backwards, he stumbles and falls, rolling to the side just before the sword comes down. And then comes his lucky break; he'd stumbled over a large stone, and the Saxon stumbled over the same stone as he swung at <SubjectName>. Burdened with the heavy shield, he goes down hard. <SubjectName> has enough time to pounce on him as he struggles to his feet; the fight is over in short order.--Witness--%?--AdviseAgainst--%?--AdviseNegative--%?--AdviseUncertain--%?--AdvisePositive--%?--AdviseFor--%?--WhatsGoingOn--%Once again, the luck of battle smiles on your people.***SitOnFence***--Gossip--%<SubjectName> evaded the decision.--FollowUp--%<SubjectHe> evaded the decision.--Subject--%I evaded the decision.--DirObject--%<SubjectName> evaded the decision.--SubjectFollowup--%I evaded the decision.--DirObjectFollowup--%<SubjectName> evaded the decision.--Menu--%?--ToArthur--%“$, please do not press me to make a public declaration just yet.”--Witness--%“I am not ready to make a decision just yet.”--AdviseAgainst--%Don't do this!--AdviseNegative--%This is not a good idea.--AdviseUncertain--%Doubt is for those who cannot lead.--AdvisePositive--%I think this could be a good idea.--AdviseFor--%Yes, by all means, do it!--WhatsGoingOn--%It should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.***SlanderArthur***--Gossip--%<SubjectName> slandered Arthur to <DirObjectName>.--FollowUp--%<SubjectHe> slandered Arthur to <DirObjectHim>.--Subject--%I did indeed discuss with <DirObjectName> my opinions on your leadership.--DirObject--%<SubjectName> slandered you to me.--SubjectFollowup--%I did indeed discuss with <DirObjectHim> my opinions on your leadership.--DirObjectFollowup--%<SubjectName> slandered you to me.--Menu--%?--ToArthur--%?--Witness--%<SubjectName> is slandering you to <DirObjectName>.--AdviseAgainst--%Don't do this!--AdviseNegative--%This is not a good idea.--AdviseUncertain--%Doubt is for those who cannot lead.--AdvisePositive--%I think this could be a good idea.--AdviseFor--%Yes, by all means, do it!--WhatsGoingOn--%It should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.***SlanderMordred***--Gossip--%<SubjectName> slandered Mordred to <DirObjectName>.--FollowUp--%<SubjectHe> slandered Mordred to <DirObjectHim>.--Subject--%I told <DirObjectName> that I thought that Mordred is an incompetent fool.--DirObject--%<SubjectName> told me that <SubjectHe> thinks that Mordred is an incompetent fool.--SubjectFollowup--%I told <DirObjectHim> that I thought that Mordred is an incompetent fool.--DirObjectFollowup--%<SubjectHe> told me that <SubjectHe> thinks that Mordred is an incompetent fool.--Menu--%“Mordred is an incompetent fool.”--ToArthur--%“Mordred is an incompetent fool.”--Witness--%#, “Mordred is an incompetent fool.”--AdviseAgainst--%Don't do this!--AdviseNegative--%This is not a good idea.--AdviseUncertain--%Doubt is for those who cannot lead.--AdvisePositive--%I think this could be a good idea.--AdviseFor--%Yes, by all means, do it!--WhatsGoingOn--%It should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.***SlapWrist***--Gossip--%Arthur found <DirObjectName> guilty, but only reprimanded <DirObjectHim>.--FollowUp--%Arthur found <DirObjectHim> guilty, but only reprimanded <DirObjectHim>.--Subject--%?--DirObject--%?--SubjectFollowup--%?--DirObjectFollowup--%?--Menu--%“I find you guilty, and I reprimand you for your improper behavior.”--ToArthur--%?--Witness--%?--AdviseAgainst--%Don't do this!--AdviseNegative--%This is not a good idea.--AdviseUncertain--%Doubt is for those who cannot lead.--AdvisePositive--%I think this could be a good idea.--AdviseFor--%Yes, by all means, do it!--WhatsGoingOn--%It should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.***SlaughterPOWs***--Gossip--%<SubjectName> killed <SubjectHisHer> Saxon prisoners.--FollowUp--%?--Subject--%?--DirObject--%?--SubjectFollowup--%?--DirObjectFollowup--%?--Menu--%?--ToArthur--%Screams waft up from the direction of <SubjectName>'s clan. “What's going on over there?” you demand. “They're killing the prisoners” comes the reply.--Witness--%?--AdviseAgainst--%?--AdviseNegative--%?--AdviseUncertain--%?--AdvisePositive--%?--AdviseFor--%?--WhatsGoingOn--%<SubjectName> must no longer have confidence in the outcome of the battle.***SlipIntoGore***--Gossip--%<SubjectName> slipped and fell into a cut-up corpse.--FollowUp--%?--Subject--%?--DirObject--%?--SubjectFollowup--%?--DirObjectFollowup--%?--Menu--%?--ToArthur--%“This way!
