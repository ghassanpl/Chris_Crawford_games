***Arthur*** You are Arthur. You are the son of Uther Pendragon by Ygraine, another man's wife. You were born in 490 AD, and took command of the British forces on your 25th birthday. You fought twelve battles against the Saxons, culminating in the gigantic victory at Mount Badon, near Bath. In the 17 years since then, Britain has known more peace than she could have expected.***Guenevere*** Guenevere is your wife. She's a bit of a chatterbox, but also a very sweet person. Although she's getting on in years, she still attracts the eyes of most men, a fact she particularly enjoys. She's an intensely emotional person, sometimes to the point of excessive volatility, but she also has a strong sense of moral responsibility. Best of all, for you as king, she's not particularly greedy. You love her very much.***Lancelot*** Lancelot is your oldest and best friend. He joined you early in the wars and single-handedly won some of those early, desperate battles. He's covered with scars, both external and internal; you can sense a weariness in him. Yet he is still a great fighter. He is proudly moralistic, unyielding in his attitudes, and always willing to take matters into his own hands. The only traits that he seems to have in modest quantites are loquaciousness and greed.***Mordred*** Mordred is your son by your half-sister Morgana. He is bright, energetic, ambitious, ruthless, proud, insensitive, calculating, greedy, and cowardly. He wants your throne, and works tirelessly to get it. Because he is of royal blood, he is immune to your justice.***Kay*** Kay is your step-brother. A good-natured fellow, none too bright, he gets along well with most people. If he weren't your stepbrother he probably would not have gotten very far in the world. He has an unfortunate tendency to stubborness, but that is more than counterbalanced by a strong sense of duty and a cool head.***Bedivere*** Bedivere is not one of the old guard; he joined you well after the wars had ended. Still, he's young and strong and great to have on your side in a fight. He's a well-rounded person with few pronounced personality traits. Moderation in all things seems to be his ruling principle.***Percival*** Ah, Percival; I can't help but smile every time I see him. He's so young, so earnest and naive, so eager to please and yet so unpolished. He makes towering blunders that would have gotten any less charming fellow banished from Camelot. I suppose it's his profound goodness that melts everyone's heart; I just wish he weren't so trusting! ***Gawain*** Gawain is one of the old guard; he was the best soldier in Camelot before Lancelot showed up. Ever since then, there's been a rivalry between the two -- in Gawain's mind. He's grown bitter about the loss of his pre-eminent place in the social hierarchy, and he tries to compensate for it in every manner possible. He is proud and has an ugly temper.***Galahad*** Galahad is Lancelot's son. This man is too good to be true. He is a saint and a killing machine at one and the same time. He lives like a priest, eschewing all material gain. He likes almost everybody, and his word is as good as gold. The women adore him, but he just doesn't seem interested in them.***Morgana*** Morgana is your half-sister. Your mother Ygraine was deceived and bedded by your father Uther; Morgana still holds your father's crime against you. In a tit-for-tat ploy, she tricked you into sleeping with her in exactly the same way that your father Uther tricked Morgana's mother Ygraine into sleeping with him; this is how Mordred was conceived. It was her revenge on you, but she will not be satisfied until Mordred has replaced you on the throne. ***Tristram*** Tristram is a Cornishman. A few of your men were travelling through Cornwall when they encountered Tristram. They made fun of his Cornish habits, and he promptly drubbed them -- then became their fast friend when they apologized. In many ways, he is like Galahad, with the exception that he plays the harp magnificently.***Isolde*** Isolde is also of Cornish nobility, and is Tristram's lady love. A very insecure woman, Isolde is constantly seeking affirmation of her value from others. She won't take any step without first getting somebody's approval. She is also a dainty little thing; the men find her very charming.***Elaine*** Elaine is a difficult woman to understand. She's almost bland, with few distinctive characteristics. The most striking thing about her is that she is rather cold and aloof from most people -- except, for some reason, for Lancelot, for whom she seems to have a strong attachment.***Nineve*** Ah, Nineve, a woman after my own soul. She's very sweet, very girlish, and very, very smart. I only wish she made more friends than she does.***Lynette*** Lynette is a nice girl, but she's so... dumb. I can't think of any nice way to say it. That woman couldn't find her way down a hill if she fell down. She talks endlessly and can never get enough wealth; even worse, she seems untrustworthy to me. But she has a kind heart and ready smile for all.***Camille*** Now here's the woman who lives in every man's fantasies. I don't know what it is about Camille, but all the men heave a great sigh when she walks by. She knows it, too, and she enjoys it immensely. She likes men -- all men, but she hates women. She's certainly more woman than I could ever handle.
