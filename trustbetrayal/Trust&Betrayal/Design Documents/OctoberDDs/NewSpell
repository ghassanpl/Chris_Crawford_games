	Sorry I've been so unforthcoming in the last two weeks.  I have beenwrapped up in design problems.  In the last two messages I tried to conveythe extent of my problems with the design, but matters only got worse andworse.  For a long time I felt that the design was changing faster than Icould document the changes, and my confidence in the stability of the designeroded with each new change.  However, in the last five days things seem tohave settled down for me; I have made no fundamental changes and have beenable to flesh out details of the design without feeling any need to go back andrearrange the basic design.  I have even resumed programming, so I have someconfidence in this new structure.  Here it is:	The central level of conflict in the game is still the mind-battle,which is still an RSP-style combat with exchange of mental "auras".  Thewinner of any battle, though, gets to keep the aura he used as well as theaura that his opponent used.  Characters will cast auras in mind-combat according to a well-understood algorithm; thus, victory in the game is dependent on knowing their aura-counts.  Discovering these aura-counts bringsus into the second main level of interaction: mind-spells.  There are sixof these.  Three determine the aura counts of each of the three forms of auras.  The other three are used to detect lies, conceal lies, or encourageaffinity.  Mind-spells are powered by "mental energy", which is consumed bytheir use and regenerated by the presence of auras.  Players will always knowof the existence of mind-battles, but determining their outcome requires special knowledge that can only be obtained from the participants in thebattle.  That special knowledge can be obtained by talking to one of theparticipants, if he is willing to give you the information, or by taking theinformation using a spell.  But one can always lie.	That's the design, in brief.  Does it make sense to anybody?.
