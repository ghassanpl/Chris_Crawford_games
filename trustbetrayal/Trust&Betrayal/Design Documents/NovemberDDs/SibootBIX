	I have reached a major turning point with Siboot.  For the last fewmonths I have designed from theory and tried to adjust the game to accomodate theory.  Now I have decided that the game is close enough to proceedto the next stage.  From here on in, theory will act as consultant rather than driver.  The game is now the driver.  I play with the game and ask, "Howdoes it play?"  and modify the game accordingly.  This second style of designis, of course, the standard style with most hack designers.  I do not rejectthis iterative style of design out of hand.  Every game, no matter how cleanand pure theoretcally, must still stand up to empirical tests of playability.My emphasis has been on this preliminary stage of theoretical development.I have spent three months on this theoretical stage.  Now I begin what shouldmore properly be called "game development".  The foundations are laid down,and from here on in my work will be directed towards refining the ideas I nowhave and turning them into a fun, playable game.	So I sat down with the game yesterday and played with it.  Yes, thereis enough game play that I can actually play through now.  And I quickly filleda notepad with comments for things needing correction.  The most importantobservation, though, concerned the quantity of information coming out at the player.  There's too much to digest.  I am now working on ways to organize thatflood of information to make it more readily digestible..
