Skordokott pauses, then suddenly breaks into his native Tayran.  "You don't even care, do you?  You just keep on going through the motions of the campaign, as if nothing has changed.  I never thought it would come to this."He stands up and steps over to the window, staring out for a long minute before turning back.  "We were friends, once.  When all this started, we promised each other that we would stay friends no matter how it came out.  Some promise."You clear your throat, starting to say something, but Skordokott cuts you off.  "I trusted you!"  The words are uttered with coldness and an edge of desperation.  "We were friends!"  Again he pauses, struggling to keep his self-control.  Then his voice becomes low and quiet.  "You have betrayed me repeatedly.  You have treated me with contempt during our conversations."  Again he pauses, groping for words.  Finally he finds them: "You are not my friend anymore."  His eyes are locked on the floor, unwilling to meet yours.  "But let us return to this charade of eeyal-bargaining." \\You swallow hard and resume the discussion.  PSkordokott puts it behind him.\"Skordokott, we can still be friends."  T4-tP"Yes," he says, "but I don't want your kind of friendship."\"I'm sorry; it's just part of the campaign."  A4+aPHe smiles weakly and shakes his head.\"You dumb sucker, you deserve everything you get."  A99-aT99-tPHis fury is evident, but he controls it.\
