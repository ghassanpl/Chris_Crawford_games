Asparuch bumps into you along the way.  He is Vetvel's fiance.  He is blunt to the point of tactlessness, but his reputation for integrity is unmatched on Kira.  "I've been meaning to tell you that Vetvel does not trust you.  She thinks that you will betray her."  What do you say? \\"Fair enough; I don't trust Vetvel either."  T8-tA4-aD4-dPAsparuch nods gravely and departs.\"I protest my innocence!  I've never betrayed Vetvel!"  T8+tPAsparuch promises to notify Vetvel of your protest.\"What do I care whether Vetvel trusts me?  She is useless."  D8-dT8-tA4-aPAsparuch's eyes widen in surprise but he leaves without a word.\"I am sorry to hear that;  I hope that I can earn her trust."  T4+tA4+aD4+dPAsparuch smiles and says that he thinks that Vetvel will change her mind.\
