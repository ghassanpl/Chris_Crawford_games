Perhaps Wiki can give you some good advice on your problem with Kendra.  You explain the situation, pointing out that you have twice requested that she perform her duties, and twice she has evaded the task.  You put the question to him bluntly: what should I do?  He hardly blinks a second before shooting back a quick and simple reply: "Press her.  Make sure she understands that this is important to you, that you will not take no for an answer.  I'm sure that she'll come around once she understands the importance of this."  You can't believe how naive Wiki's advice is.  How do you respond to him? \\You shrug your shoulders and forget his stupid advice.  PWiki puts his arm around your shoulder and says, "This will work out just fine."\"Wiki, she is adamant; this won't work."  PWiki responds, "You'll never know until you try, will you?"\"I know that this will fail."  PWiki says, "Don't be so pessimistic!"\"Wiki, that's the dumbest advice I've gotten in a long time!"  A4-aD2-dPWiki seems a little hurt but changes the subject.\
