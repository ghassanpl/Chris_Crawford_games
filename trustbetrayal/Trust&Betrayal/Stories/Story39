Chris Crawford is waiting outside, dressed in a zoot suit, swinging a pocket watch by a fake gold chain.  "Struck out again, huh, baby?" he taunts.  "Maybe you haven't figured it all out yet.  Let Uncle Chris give you some advice."  He sidles up to you, blocking the escape path that you were eyeing.  "I bet you just walk in on somebody and start offering them deals, right?  Well, maybe you can get away with that kid stuff in the Beginner Level game, but in the Expert Level game, you gotta use your head.  Look, how would you feel if somebody came barging into your house talking serious deals about tattling on other people?  You'd be pretty reluctant, wouldn't you?  Especially if they jumped right into it without so much as a howdy-do?  You gotta break the ice first.  You walk into somebody's house, you say 'hello.'  It's a courtesy thing, you know what I mean?  Then you make a little small talk, to sorta warm things up.  You can really warm up the conversation by offering some free information about somebody betraying somebody else.  Just don't pop the first deal-offer until you've got 'em warmed up and ready.  So, baby, the name of the game is..."  The sound of a big band playing softly fades into the scene;  Chris starts a little soft-shoe and starts singing "Getting to Know You."  By Siboot, is he bad!  You stand dumbfounded as he dances to the left, disappearing behind a small shed.  A clatter of garbage cans terminates the music. \\Sheesh!  PYou're right; sheesh!\Act like nothing happened.  PDid anything happen?\Let's get on with the game.  POn with the game!\Sing "Getting to Know You"  PThe big band picks up the music with you.  Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance along with you.\
