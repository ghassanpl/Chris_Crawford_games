You have been waiting such a long time, you begin to lose patience.  Perhaps you should just go.  This is so BORING!  But then you hear the deep rumble of an engine.  What could that be, you wonder.  You step away from the front porch inquisitively, into the middle of the small square in front of %'s house.  Suddenly a 50-ton German Tiger tank rolls around the corner, it's gigantic treads ripping and tearing at the ground.  You stand frozen in terror in the open as the tank roars up to you, stopping just in front of you.  Its huge gun lowers until it is pointing directly at your face.  You are quaking in fear; your knees are knocking together.  A hand emerges from the muzzle of the gun and offers you a small note.  You take it, open it, and read, "It has come to the attention of The Powers That Be that you are possibly not taking Random Events (the clever little stories of which this is but a single example) as seriously as you might.
