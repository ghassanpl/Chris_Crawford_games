Waiting at the door as you leave is Zubi.  "My, my, what a surprise!" she says, her eeyal dripping with sarcasm.  "I wondered what you might have been doing here.  I'll just bet you were cooking up some sort of sneaky plan, weren't you?  Well, don't worry, I have a few things to discuss that concern you as well." \\Just ignore her and continue on.  PShe laughs derisively as she goes inside.\"I'm sure you do, Zubi.  That's why I came here."  D50-BPShe laughs, "Nice try, but I'm NOT frightened!"  PShe looks taken aback, and enters quietly.\Smile wickedly and say, "Yes, I have been cooking up something good."  PShe just laughs and proceeds inside.\"You'll get yours, Zubi."  PShe laughs derisively at you.\
