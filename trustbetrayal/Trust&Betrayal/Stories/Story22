To underscore the misery of this day, who should show up but Aslyn.  Good old Aslyn!  Doubtless with a thousand questions about how and why you blew it last night in mind combat.  For a moment, you sieze on the faint hope that perhaps he has lost faith in you now that you have been shown to be vulnerable.  But no, that is not meant to be.  He rushes toward you eagerly, offering his condolences.  "Those dirty rats!" he snarls.  "They put you in a jam.  There was no way you could have beaten them!"  This from somebody who knows nothing of mind combat.  Wait a minute!  Just how come he knows that I lost last night?  Come to think of it, everybody seems to know.  The whole town has been treating me with sympathy today.  They ALL know!  How do they do it?  Is it some sort of gossip network?  You ponder the problem for a moment, then it occurs to you:  everybody is aware of the Land of Auras.  When you go out into it to do combat, you notice them as little flickers of mind-energy.  They cannot move as freely as you, nor can they muster auras or engage in combat, but they enter that world when they dream as surely as you do.  And they must know what happens in that world.  The Land of Auras is not the personal domain of the acolytes; it is a world populated by all the citizens of Kira.  And perhaps someday soon we will find some Laminans there.  Back to Aslyn.  He is still expecting an answer to his fiercely loyal assertions.  What are you going to tell him? \\"Well, lemme tell you about the fight..."  8JHPAslyn is so happy to hear all the details.\"Yes, well, be that as it may, I have to go now."  2HPHe tries for a little longer and gives up.\"Aslyn, I really have no time for all your questions."  4HPHe's disappointed but accepts the situation.\"Get away from me, kid!"  8HPYour harsh words upset him deeply and he runs away.\
