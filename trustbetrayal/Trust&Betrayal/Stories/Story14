Your conversation with % is interrupted by her aunt Dracina.  The old Klast used to run the clothing group and was generally feared and hated by all who came in contact with her.  Old age has not mellowed Dracina; she is still a  tyrant.  She gives you hardly a glance and proceeds to converse with % in Klast. This is in itself quite an insult, as it is long-established convention that eeyal is the only proper language to use in mixed groups, unless pragmatic reasons require the greater precision and expressiveness of a local language. You shrug off the insult, for Dracina is chewing out % over some infraction.  % herself is obviously embarrassed by her aunt's intrusion at a very delicate moment and seems to be trying to placate her and get rid of her.  Dracina, however, seems determined to press her point; an ugly family fight seems about to explode.
