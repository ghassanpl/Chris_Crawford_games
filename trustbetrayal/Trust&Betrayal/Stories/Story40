"Har, har, har!"  It's Chris Crawford; he's been waiting for you.  "You blew it last night in combat, didn't ya?  Har, har, har!  You're never going to figure this game out, are you?  Here, lemme give you a few tips.  First, you've gotta evaluate the other guy's aura counts.  If they're all the same, like 7-7-7, then you've got problems, because there's no way to figure out what to do, but if there's any difference at all, then you've got something to work on.  For example, if he's got 6-4-7 (tanaga, katsin, and shial), then you know that he's going to try to get another katsin, because that's what he's lowest in.  The only way to get a katsin is to play a tanaga, so you know he'll play a tanaga, so you play your shial, and you'll beat his tanaga.  It's that simple, at least in the Beginner and Intermediate Level games.  In the Expert Level game, it gets trickier.  He takes into consideration what you've got, and adjusts his move accordingly.  So, you've got to anticipate his action, but it's even tougher because you don't know what he knows and what he doesn't know.  But, hey, if you're going to play Expert Level, you don't need MY help, do you?"  \\No, I DON'T need your help.  PSo why'd you lose last night, big shot?\Thanks for the tip!  PYou're very welcome.\Would you mind giving me a little under-the-table help?  PWhat?!?!?  Cheat?!?!?  Tsk, tsk!\Goodbye.  PGoodbye.\
