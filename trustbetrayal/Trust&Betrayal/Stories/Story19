Oh, no!  Here comes Aslyn!  You've been lucky so far --- he hasn't caught you in days, but it looks like your luck just ran out.  Damn your lousy stinking luck anyway.  Oh, well, you shouldn't be too hard on the kid.  He's bright, he's energetic, and he will surely be the next acolyte when you retire.  Lordy, that kid is blessed with power!  There must be some sort of genetic effect going on; it seems as if each generation is more powerful in eeyal than the last, and Aslyn is the best example of that effect.  If you had half his strength as an youth, you'd be wiping the floor with the other acolytes today.  You wonder, in ten or thirty years, when the next campaign is fought, what will mind-combat feel like?  You shudder;  it's pretty rough right now, and with combatants like Aslyn, it will only get worse.  Ah, well, that's not your battle.	Aslyn intercepts you, his eyes glowing with excitement.  There's no doubt that the kid idolizes you; if only he knew how far his native talents outstripped your own.  Your only advantage over him is greater experience and polish.  "Good day" he says, his voice dripping with respect.  "May I come along with you?"  How do you respond? \\"No, I'm sorry; I am much too busy."  2HPHe looks disappointed but accepts your brush-off.\"Certainly!  We can talk until I reach my destination!"  4JHPHe joyously pumps you for information about the campaign all the way there.\"Aslyn, just leave me alone!"  6HPHe is deeply hurt and wanders away.\Ignore him.  PHe continues to pester you all the way.\
