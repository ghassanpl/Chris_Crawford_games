	The conversation with % has been going on for some time when @ turns away from you for a moment and you suddenly realize that ^ tunic has entangled itself behind $, hoisting itself up and exposing a goodly amount of what should be private skin.  You stare in some curiosity for a second; after all, the private parts of &s are not something that you see every day.  @ starts to turn back to face you, and you impulsively: \\glance downward and decide not to mention it.  P% notices and straightens out the tunic. \burst out laughing at $.  A8-aD8-dP% reddens in embarrasment and anger.\say, "Um, %, you should straighten your tunic, it's out of order."  A4+aP% hurriedly rectifies the error.\step up, stumble into $, and secretly straighten ^ tunic in the scuffle.  A2-aP% calls you a clumsy oaf.\
