Tervel accosts you before you go twenty paces.  Tervel is such a neat lady.  Her family's house was right next to yours, and you were playmates and best friends all through childhood.  She grew up to become one of the most popular young ladies on Kira.  Full of fun, endlessly talented, and witty, Tervel brought sparkle to every enterprise she joined.  What a blow it must have been to all the young Ripi men when Tervel made it clear that she would have nobody but Wiki.  But everyone agrees, it is a perfect match: the sly, fun-loving Wiki and the buoyant, laughing Tervel.  And what can I do for Tervel today, you ask.  She wrinkles her glowing Ripi nose and pulls you aside.  "I just wanted you to know something," she says.  "Wiki really trusts you.  You know what a softy he is.  You won't abuse that trust, will you?" \\"Of course not!  Wiki can trust me absolutely!"  T8+tPTervel smiles a big, happy smile and dances off.\"Tervel, you know that the candidacy is a serious time for all of us."  T4-tPTervel is surprised and apprehensive.\"After what he did to me, my trust in him is shattered."  T8-tPTervel is saddened by your words.  She leaves.\"Abuse?  Me?  Tsk, tsk!"  T2-tPTervel laughs.\
