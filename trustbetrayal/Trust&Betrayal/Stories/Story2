Skordokott seems tired; it strikes you that you have never seen him relaxing or resting.  Yet, here he stands in front of you, obviously fatigued.  He has not been sleeping well, that much is plain to see.  You know there isn't much point in bringing the matter up; Skordokott is much too proud to admit to any kind of weakness.  This is the side effect of all that mental combat, all those long nights wrapped in auras.  They saturate your mind, soaking you in extravagent dreams and horrible nightmares.  After this is over we will all need a good rest.  You wonder, if Skordokott is showing the effects so readily, how you appear to be holding up.  You probably look even worse than he does.  You are moved to share your thoughts with Skordokott, but you hesitate.  Should you say: \\Nothing, just let the matter pass.  PSkordokott lets it pass, too.\"Skordokott, you look very tired."  40A-BA4+aPHe smiles and says, "No, I'm fine."  PHe stands erect and says, "You are badly mistaken.  I'm fine."\"I feel more tired than you look."  60A-BA4+aPHe grins and says, "You DO look awful; why don't you get some sleep?"  A2-aPWithout missing a beat he shoots back: "You LOOK more tired than I do."\"All this mental combat has really gotten to you."  80A-BA8+aPHe smiles wanly and says, "Yes, maybe so; I'll be glad when it's over."  60A-BP"I can handle it -- I've been preparing for a long time."  D4+dA2-aPHe scowls fiercely and mutters, "Tonight I'll give you something to get to you."\
