It is a hot day and you do not relish the thought of waiting here in the open, but there seems to be no other way to insure that you'll catch % when @ comes out, so you stand there in the sun waiting.  You hear an odd sound and cock your ear.  It's some kind of chicken...wait a minute!  There are no chickens on Kira!  Then you hear it more plainly: a definite cackling sound.  Oh no, you think, not Chris Crawford again!  Suddenly he roars around the corner of a house down the street.  His arms are spread like a bird's and --- Holy Shial, he's flying!  He was steeply banked making the curve, and now he's straightening out, making straight for you, going at least fifty miles an hour.   His face is animated with a demonic grin.  You duck as he flashes just over your head, screaming "VAROOM!" at the top of his lungs.  You turn to watch as he climbs steeply up into the sky, now giggling faintly.  A contrail sprouts from his feet and he begins to spell out a message.  "DAGER!" it says.  He goes back and tries to change it, but there are no backspace keys in the sky.  He settles for an N floating above the now-dissolving G.  Then he resumes his message.  When he is done, it says, "% about to win!  Attack ^ or risk losing!". \\Golly-gee!  PGarsh-darn!\Golly-gee!  PGarsh-darn!\Golly-gee!  PGarsh-darn!\Golly-gee!  PGarsh-darn!\
