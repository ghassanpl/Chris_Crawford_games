Your path takes you directly past Chris Crawford's house.  You can't resist the temptation to peek into his window to see what he is doing.  There he sits in front of his computer, staring intently at the screen.  Such an odd fish, you think.  Now he leans forward and types furiously for a moment, now he leans back and thinks some more.  There is something almost comical in the way he takes that computer so seriously.  Suddenly he leaps from his chair and stalks about the room, muttering a stream of seemingly random words:  "Ties in.... bad fit... development?... too elliptical... maybe... yes, maybe sequential..."  He stops dead in his tracks, shouts "NO, NO, NO!", then turns to face you directly.  You cringe and duck to hide.  He stomps directly to the window and stands silently, staring out at nothing --- you are amazed that he does not see you.  Perhaps you should: \\Freeze and do nothing.  PHe stares out the window for several minutes before returning to his computer.\Smile wanly and say, "Umm, hi there, Chris!"  PHe does a double-take at you, then says "Oh, um, salutations."\Slink away and let him do his job.  PHe never did see you.\Make a silly face at him to try to get his attention.  C4PHe is startled by your action and looks peeved.\
