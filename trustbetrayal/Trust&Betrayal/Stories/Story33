What a day!  You can't seem to get anything done.  And to add to your troubles, here comes Teletz.  You have NEVER liked Teletz; he always struck you as an oily, untrustworthy person.  How he ever linked up with a person like Zubi, you will never understand.  The two of them are opposites in almost every respect.  And now he wants to talk to you; not a good sign.  Oh well, you think, let's get this over with.  He seems to be in a foul mood to boot.  That's just great.  He gives you the very thinnest of greetings before launching into his speech:  "I've just come from talking with Zubi, and she has really had it with you.  I don't know what you did to make her so mad, but you are definitely on her blacklist.  And if I may add, that suits me just fine."	Well, how are you going to respond? \\"Suits me fine, too."  A8-aP"Good!" he says, and marches off.\"What did I do?  I LIKE Zubi!"  T4-tA8+aPTeletz looks very skeptical and leaves without saying a word.\"You can tell Zubi that I've had it with her!"  A16-aD4-dPTeletz raises his fleshy eyebrow and backs off.\"OK, thank you."  D4+dPTeletz says nothing as he leaves.\
