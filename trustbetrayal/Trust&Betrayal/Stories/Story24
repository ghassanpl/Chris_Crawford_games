While waiting, you happen to glance up and behold some clouds.  Now, clouds themselves are not common in Kira's dry atmosphere, and so they are held to be things of beauty in themselves, often wondered at.  You lean against a nearby wall and stare up at the grouping, idly enjoying the slowly changing pattern that they present.  But then something special arrests your attention.  The clouds seem to be grouping themselves in an odd fashion.  You watch with widening eyes as three large clouds mutate and glide into positions that form the corners of an equilateral triangle.  Each one has the sharp corner in the proper position, each one traces the edges of the triangle unmistakably.  You look around you, hoping that there is someone nearby who can witness this remarkable apparition and testify to its existence, but you are alone.  When you look back up, the clouds have already drifted away from their positions and the airy triangle no longer exists. \\?  P?\?  P?\?  P?\?  P?\
