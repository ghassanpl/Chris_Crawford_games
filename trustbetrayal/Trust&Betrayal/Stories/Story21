You're in a pretty good mood;  you won a victory last night and you feel that you are climbing on top of things.  But now here comes Aslyn, the perfect person to spoil your mood.  He's all set to bury you with a hundred questions about the details of mind combat.  He'll want to know how it works, what it feels like, how you make it happen, how you meditate, if you're tired afterwards, and every other detail he can imagine to ask about.  He starts off simply enough.  "How are you?  I heard that you stomped 'em last night in mind combat.  Wow, that's really great!  You're the greatest!"  He's getting more sophisticated, you muse.  Trying to suck me in with a compliment.  All I need to do is acknowledge it in any way and then he can follow up with some sort of question that I'll be obligated to answer, and then we'll be off and running for an interminable game of Twenty Questions.  Twenty!  Ha!  You should be so lucky!  So what will you say to him? \\"That's very kind of you to say!  What would you like to talk about?"  4JHPAslyn deluges you with questions, all of which you patiently answer.\"Thanks.  I must be on my way now.  Take care."  2HPHe seems disappointed.\"Aslyn, I appreciate your concern, but I am a very busy person."  4HPHe pesters you for another minute or two before giving up.\"Will you please leave me alone, you pest?"  8HPHe is stung by your words and says nothing else.\
