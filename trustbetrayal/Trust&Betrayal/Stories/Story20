Here comes Aslyn again.  You try to duck down a side alley between two cottages but he's onto you; he heads down another route and intercepts you.  "How is the campaign going?" he asks earnestly.  "Are you doing well?  Are you clobbering them?"  You look at the kid for a moment.  He is so well-meaning.  He knows that someday he may be called upon to perform a similar function and he is only trying to prepare himself in the best way he can.  You really should have taken this kid under your wing, given him help and encouragement.  Certainly he has the talent to deserve it.  And were you not the recipient of just such assistance from your predecessor?  Did he not take you aside and teach you about the techniques of mind combat, about the general strategy of the conflict?  Of course, the information he gave you was hopelessly obsolete; the techniques that won Feslym the Shepherdship are no longer effective.  And so it is with this kid.  The knowledge that you now have really could not help him.  He must be able to figure it out for himself.  Still, the advice and support that you received in your youth helped you immensely; it gave you confidence.  Does not this youth deserve as much as you received?  If only he weren't so repellant, so insistent, so naive.  You just don't like him.  But you can't tell him that.  What DO you say? \\"Sure kid, let's talk." (You proceed to tell him all about things.)  8JHPAsyln is immensely pleased at the attention you give him.\"I'm sorry Aslyn, but I really don't have time to chat."  2HPHe lets you go your way, looking just a little forlorn.\"Aslyn, will you please leave me alone?"  6HPHe looks a little hurt and backs off.\"Leave me alone!  Don't ever bother me again!"  16HPNow you've done it; he is crushed.  He sits down and starts to cry.\
