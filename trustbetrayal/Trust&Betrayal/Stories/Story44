Once again, Aslyn has found you and this time he has the biggest, stupidest grin on his face.  He seems immensely proud of himself.  He pulls you out of the walkway and drags you off to a quiet place.  "OK, Aslyn, what gives?  I really have important business to do!"  He can barely control his excitement; he chortles as he blurts out, "I know all the aura-counts!"  "What?!?!" you gasp.  "What do you mean?"  He looks around to make certain that nobody can hear your conversation.  "I've been sneaking around, eavesdropping on the eeyal-conversations between all the acolytes.  I can feel most of them right through the walls.  It's real easy.  Isn't that a neat trick?"  You step back, aghast at what Aslyn has done.  If word of this gets out, if anybody even suspects what has happened, not only might your candidacy be threatened, but the legitimacy of the entire campaign would be called into question.  Holy Siboot, this could start a damn war back on Lamina!  On the other hand, the information he has is invaluable.  It would certainly give you quite an edge tonight.  What do you say to Aslyn? \\You are a criminal!  Never speak to me again!  99HPHis face wilts, and he slinks off, utterly crushed.\Give me the information, but never do it again!  QPHe transmits the information to you with eeyal.\I don't want the information.  Don't ever do it again!  PHe is hurt, but takes it well.\Give me the information, and keep up the good work.  QPHe transmits the aura-counts using eeyal.\
