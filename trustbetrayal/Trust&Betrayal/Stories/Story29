You are beginning to feel that your efforts with Kendra as a sin-bearer are doomed to failure, and you decide to take an unconventional step.  Zubi seems a decent type; perhaps she can help. You explain the situation to her, going over the details carefully, pointing out that Kendra has twice refused your legitimate request.  You emphasize that you are very much in need of her services as a sin-bearer.  Zubi seems sympathetic; she is in fact quite angry at Kendra's callous dismissal of a very serious responsibility.  Moreover, she seems angry that any Kiran should be denied the right to a sin-bearer.  Your confidence is bolstered by her behavior; you decide to take the plunge.  Leaning forward, you ask very quietly, would she be willing to act as your sin-bearer?  Not forever, just on a temporary basis until we can get Kendra straightened out?  	Zubi is taken aback by your suggestion.  It is grossly improper, she says.  Your sin-bearer is assigned to you for life; only the Shepherd can make changes in the arrangement.  She would not toy with so serious an institution.  She categorically refuses to consider the notion.  What do you do? \\Shrug your shoulders and accept the failure.  D2+dPZubi says that it's for the best.\Try to explain the logic of your suggestion.  PZubi will have none of it.\Lose your temper and yell at Zubi.  A8-aD4-dPZubi is adamant; she will not consider your suggestion.\Thank her for her consideration.  A2+aPZubi says that she sympathizes with your problem.\
